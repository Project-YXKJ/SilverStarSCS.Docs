How to interact with Docs
=========================

This chapter gives an introduction on how to interact with this document. This assumes
you are reading an HTML site. The options and formatting will be different for other
output formats such as epub.

A document is organized into **chapters**. Each chapter is a separate page. Chapters can
be nested into a hierarchy of sub-chapters. Typically, each chapter will be organized
into a series of **headings** to subdivide a chapter.

Navigation
----------

There are several methods for navigating through the chapters of a document.

The **sidebar** on the left provides a list of all chapters, and the right provides a
list of all sub-chapters. Clicking on any of the chapter titles will load that page.

The sidebar may not automatically appear if the window is too narrow, particularly on
mobile displays. In that situation, the menu icon (three horizontal bars) at the
top-left of the page can be pressed to open and close the sidebar.

The **arrow buttons** at the bottom of the page can be used to navigate to the previous
or the next chapter.

The **back to top** when the page scrolls upon can be used to navigate to the top of the
page.

Top menu bar
------------

The menu bar at the top of the page provides some icons for interacting with the
document.

e.g. change dark/light mode.

Search
------

There is a search box above the left navigation bar.
